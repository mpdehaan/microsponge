"""List the string literals inside functions and classes of Python files, which the style rules say should be named constants.

Run from the top folder, naming files or folders:

    .venv/bin/python tools/loose_strings.py test            # a count per file
    .venv/bin/python tools/loose_strings.py -v test/test_x.py   # the strings themselves, most common first

Docstrings, blank strings, long text and strings at the top level of a module (which are the
constants' own values) are left out. Not everything it lists is wrong: a test's own data can
stay literal, so it's a list to read, not a rule to enforce.
